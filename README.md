 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

My Prototype 1 was heavily influenced by the Roll-A-Ball game, but I incorporated the more important aspects of what I got out of the ApplePicker and Mission Demolition projects. ApplePicker - I incorporated code revolving around the collision with another object and the removal of lives (instead of baskets). Mission Demolition - I had the game reset if you lose all your lives. I was trying to have it prompt to a new screen, but I unfortunately ran out of time so I will be sure to incorporate it in future projects.
